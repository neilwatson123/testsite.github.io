    <h1>Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)</h1>
<p> This is a website dedicated to the rare, rapidly-progressive and universally fatal disease called CJD. CJD is a prion disease, in which brain cells rapidly deteriorate and die as toxic proteins misfold and accumulate in the brain. If you have any questions, <span style="color: lightgreen; font-weight:bold;"> please comment below. </span> <p/>
<p> Below are some links you can check out about CJD, what it is, who gets it, why it happens, and what we currently do about it when patients are affected. </p>
